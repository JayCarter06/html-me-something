              Hi, my name is Jeremy Carter, and I love to travel. 
              I have been to over 20 states and 5 countries. 
              Here are some of the places I have visited, and 
              some of the places I will like to go.

                  <h2>Bermuda</h2>
                <p>
              I went to Bermuda when I was 16. I got tricked into 
              running a half a marathon, but that is a story for 
              another time. The scenery was unbelievable, the pure 
              white sand, and the horizon that seemed to go on forever.

                  <h3>Toronto, CA</h3>
                  <p>
              I am originally from Detroit, MI,which is minutes from the 
              Canadian border. Therefore I found myself going back and 
              forth quite often. I took many trips to Toronto which is still 
              to this day my favorite big city to visit.

                  <h3>Jamaica Dune Falls</h3>
                  <p>
              The first cruise I ever went on was through Royal Carribean,
              and the highlight of that trip was our stop in Jamaica. We had to
              take a hour long bus ride up a mountain into a rainforest until we
              reached our destination. We had arrived at the Dune Falls, which was 
              a waterfall that you can climb up and down in groups.
